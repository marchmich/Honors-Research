# Supporting Materials for Class Expositions

This folder contains the supporting materials shared in class for the scheduled expositions. Each resource includes slides, explanations, and visual references to aid the understanding of the topics discussed.

## Contents:


- [Deep Learning Models](https://github.com/marchmich/Honors-Research/blob/main/Documents/Models.pdf)  
  Overview of architectures used for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation, including CNNs, YOLO, and Transformers.
  
- [Model Selection](https://github.com/marchmich/Honors-Research/blob/main/Documents/Model_Selection.pdf)  
  Resources covering how to choose appropriate models based on dataset characteristics, performance metrics, and trade-offs.

- [Model Training](https://github.com/marchmich/Honors-Research/blob/main/Documents/Model_Training.pdf)
  Tutorials and best practices for training models, including optimization techniques, loss functions, batch normalization, overfitting, and use of validation sets.

- [Feature Extraction](https://github.com/marchmich/Honors-Research/blob/main/Documents/Feature_Extraction.pdf)
  Materials covering key techniques like SIFT, HOG, LBP, edge and corner detection, and how they are used to convert images into machine-readable features.
  
- [Evaluation of Models (Author: Jenny Yakarta)](https://github.com/marchmich/Honors-Research/blob/main/Documents/Evaluation.pdf)
  Guides on assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curves, and validation strategies.
