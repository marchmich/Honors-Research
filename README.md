# Honors Research: Introduction to Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This repository documents the progress and materials for my honors research project, which explores foundational and practical aspects of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

## Overview

The goal of this research is to:
- Understand the core principles of machine learning algorithms.
- Gain hands-on experience with deep learning architectures like CNNs and RNNs.
- Apply these models to real-world tasks such as image classification and object detection.
- Reflect on the trade-offs, challenges, and decisions made throughout the model development lifecycle.

The project is structured in two parts:
1. **Theoretical Understanding** ‚Äì Learn the concepts behind ML/DL.
2. **Practical Implementation** ‚Äì Conduct and document experiments.

## üî¨ Experiments (Code)

Each experiment demonstrates a specific concept or application of machine learning or deep learning:

- [Experiment 1](https://github.com/marchmich/Honors-Research/tree/main/FRecogV_1)  
  *Supervised classification using a simple neural network on a structured dataset.*

- [Experiment 2](https://github.com/marchmich/Honors-Research/tree/main/FRecogV_2)  
  *Image classification with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).*

- [Experiment 3](https://github.com/marchmich/Honors-Research/tree/main/fromScratch)  
  *Object detection using a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., YOLO or Faster R-CNN).*
